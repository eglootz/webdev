      <h1>Using python and the HUE-API to control my LED-lights</h1>
      <p class="date">February 01, 2022</p>
      <h2>The reason behind all of this</h2>
      <h3>The project week</h3>
      <p>
        We have this special week at our school - everyone has to think of a
        cool project that interests them and talk with a teacher about it. If
        they agree, well then everything is settled. This week will be in March,
        and in it everyone gets seven days to work on the project, write a huge
        paper about the theory and submit a practical part.
      </p>

      <h3>My project</h3>
      <p>
        I chose the project you've already seen in the title - I wanted to
        control the lights I have in my room. Using the standard program would
        be way too easy, so I wanted to learn how to work with API's, control
        the lights using one, put everything in a pretty GUI and code some
        special features. One of those is letting my lights turn red whenever
        someone comes near my door.
      </p>
      <h2>The plan</h2>
      <p>Things I want to achieve:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          a practical program to control my lights in more ways than before
        </li>
        <li>a pretty graphical user interface</li>
        <li>a way to detect motion</li>
        <li>syncing my pc-lights and those in my room</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The language (it's Python)</h3>
      <p>
        I plan on using python, because that's the only language I'm comfortable
        enough to take on a fairly big project like this. I may have to learn
        JavaScript in the process, because of the work with API's.
